# Python Programs: File Reading, Writing & Error Handling

This repository contains two Python scripts that demonstrate how to read from and write to files in Python, along with basic error handling.

## ðŸ“„ Files Included

1. **Task_1_Read_File_With_Error_Handling.py**  
   A Python program that:
   - Opens and reads a text file named `sample.txt`.
   - Prints its content line by line.
   - Handles the case where the file does not exist by displaying a user-friendly error message.

2. **Task_2_Write_Append_Read_File.py**  
   A Python program that:
   - Takes user input and writes it to a file named `output.txt`.
   - Appends additional data to the same file.
   - Reads and displays the final content of the file.

## âœ… How to Run the Programs

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine (version 3.x recommended).

Then, run the scripts using the command line or any Python IDE:

```bash
python Task_1_Read_File_With_Error_Handling.py
python Task_2_Write_Append_Read_File.py
